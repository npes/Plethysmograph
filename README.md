# Plethysmograph
EAL it-technology 3rd semester electronic project 2016

Plethysmo means density.
Build a device (Pulse plethysmograph) that can measure your pulse with an led shining through your finger and measured with a photo diode.
The project can be expanded with pulse oximetry which measures the oxygen level in your blood.
